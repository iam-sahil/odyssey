## What are the community components?

Community components are animated components contributed by the community. Unlike other Animate UI components, they arenâ€™t required to use our primitives, so their APIs may vary and some may offer limited configuration (few or no props).

**The goal is to make it easy for anyone to publish and share animated components with the community.**

## How to add a community component?

Perform a PR by adding a new component to the community components.

Components must comply with a few rules:

- be animated
- use tailwindcss
- use motion and not another animation engine such as GSAP
